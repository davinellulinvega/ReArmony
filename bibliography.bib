	abstract = {Recent discoveries about the neural system and cellular mechanisms in pathways mediating classical fear conditioning have provided a foundation for pursuing concurrent connectionist models of this form of emotional learning. The models described are constrained by the known anatomy underlying the behavior being simulated. To date, implementations capture salient features of fear learning, both at the level of behavior and at the level of single cells, and additionally make use of generic biophysical constraints to mimic fundamental excitatory and inhibitory transmission properties. Owing to the modular nature of the systems model, biophysical modeling can be carried out in a single region, in this case the amygdala. Future directions include application of the biophysical model to questions about temporal summation in the two sensory input paths to amygdala, and modeling of an attentional interrupt signal that will extend the emotional processing model to interactions with cognitive systems.},

	abstract = {Conditioning of fear reactions to an auditory conditioned stimulus ({CS}) paired with a footshock unconditioned stimulus ({US}) involves {CS} transmission to the amygdala from the auditory thalamus, the auditory cortex, or both. This article presents a simple neural network model of this neural system. The model consists of modules of mutually inhibitory nonlinear units representing the different relevant anatomical structures of the thalamo-amygdala and thalamo-corticoamygdala circuitry. Frequency-specific changes produced by fear conditioning were studied at the behavioral level (stimulus generalization) and the single-unit level (receptive fields). The findings mirror effects observed in conditioning studies of animals. This computational model provides an initial grounding for explorations of how emotional information and behavior are related to anatomical and physiological observations.},

	abstract = {The conditioning of fear responses to a simple acoustic stimulus (pure tone) paired with footshock can be mediated by the transmission of auditory information to the lateral nucleus of the amygdala from either the auditory thalamus or the auditory cortex. We examined the processing capacity of the thalamo-amygdala pathway by making lesions of the auditory cortex and testing the extent to which conditioned fear responses generalized to tones other than the one paired with footshock. Two studies were performed, one in an anatomically constrained computational model of the fear conditioning network and the other in rats. Stimulus generalization was unaffected in both. These findings support the validity of the model as an approach to studying the neural basis of conditioned fear learning, and in addition suggest that the thalamo-amygdala pathway, possibly by the use of population coding, is capable of performing at least crude stimulus discriminations.},

	issn = {0270-6474},
	abstract = {The goal of the present study was to examine the contribution of thalamo-amygdala and thalamo-cortico-amygdala projections to fear conditioning. Lesions were used to destroy either the thalamo-cortico-amygdala projection, the thalamo-amygdala projection, or both projections, and the effects of such lesions on the acquisition of conditioned fear responses (changes in arterial pressure and freezing behavior) to a tone paired with footshock were measured. In each group of animals examined, a large lesion of the acoustic thalamus, including all nuclei of the medial geniculate body and adjacent portions of the posterior thalamus, was made on one side of the brain to block auditory transmission to the forebrain at the level of the thalamus on that side. In this way, experimental lesions could be made on the contralateral side of the brain. Thus, animals with thalamo-amygdala pathway lesions received a large lesion of the acoustic thalamus on one side. Contralaterally, only the nuclei that project to the amygdala (the medial division of the medial geniculate body, the posterior intralaminar nucleus, and the suprageniculate nucleus) were selectively destroyed, leaving much of the thalamo-cortico-amygdala projection intact. For thalamo-cortico-amygdala pathway lesions, the acoustic thalamus was destroyed on one side and temporal and perirhinal cortices were ablated contralaterally. In these animals, thalamo-amygdala projections were intact on the side of the cortical lesion. Destruction of either pathway alone had no effect on auditory fear conditioning. However, combined lesions of the two sensory pathways disrupted conditioning.},

	abstract = {Hebb's postulate of learning envisages that activation or inactivation of extant synaptic contacts in plastic neural networks depends on the synchronous impulse activity of pre- and postsynaptic nerve cells. The physiological mechanism proposed here for this process posits that at synapses acting according to Hebb's postulate, the receptors for the neurotransmitter are eliminated from the postsynaptic membrane by the transient reversals of the sign of membrane polarization that occur during action potential impulses in the postsynaptic cell. But, since the release of neurotransmitter drives the membrane potential of the synaptic zone towards a level about half-way between the negative-inside resting potential and the positive-inside action potential, it would follow that the membrane patches surrounding the receptors of a synapse whose activity has contributed to setting off the postsynaptic impulse would be spared the full extent of the noxious polarity reversal. This mechanism can account for a neurophysiologically documented example of the operation of Hebb's postulate, namely the plasticity of the connections between fourth- and fifth-order neurons in the visual cortex of cats.},
